-- | Prunes most block headers and block payloads from forks that are older than
-- the given number of blocks.
--
-- This function guarantees that the predecessors of all remaining nodes also
-- remain in the database and that there are are no tangling references.
--
-- This function doesn't guarantee to delete all blocks on forks. A small number
-- of fork blocks may not get deleted.
--
-- The function takes callbacks that are invoked on each block header and
-- paylaod hash. The callback takes a parameter that indicates whether the
-- related block is pruned or not.
